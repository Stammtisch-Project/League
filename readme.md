# Stammtisch Project League

This is the official ruleset by the Stammtisch Project which can be used by everyone to have consistent rules.

These rules are never final and can always be updated. For an update/pull request to get accepted it must run through an approval process.

The main focus should be on the fun of the game but since unfair play isn't really funny these rules are created.
